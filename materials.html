                This page contains carefully prepared learning resources for the
                <strong>Python for Data Analysis</strong> program. Learners are encouraged
                to download the materials ahead of each session and follow along
                during practical demonstrations.

            <h2>Session 1: Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                The first session focuses on building a strong foundation in Python.
                You will learn how Python works, how to write and run scripts, and how
                to use core data structures commonly applied in data analysis tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before attending the session, please download the
                <a href="pyfundamentals.pdf" download>Session 1 learning guide (PDF)</a>.
                This document will be used throughout the class for live practice,
                explanations, and exercises.
            </p>

            <p>
                To support hands-on learning, practice files have been prepared.
                Click to download the
                <a href="practice-files.zip" download>Python practice files</a> and keep
                them on your computer. These files will help you practice writing
                scripts, working with lists and dictionaries, and running code in
                VS Code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additional reference notes are also available. You may download the
                <a href="python-notes.pdf" download>Python reference notes</a> to revise
                concepts after the session or when practicing independently.
